### Details about Project

Hi, I have created this interesting project using the MERN stack as an internship assignment of Flexmoney.
In this web app an user can register themselves for the yoga classes. 
I enjoyed while creating this project as I learned many new things while creating this project such as form validation, connecting the frontend to the backend and deploying the web app online.

My approach for this project was:-

- Create frontend of the admission form using html, css and reactjs.
- Make the form responsive so that it does not get distorted in any device.
- Create the backend of the form using nodejs, expressjs and mongoDB.
- Do the basic validations as stated in the assignment.
- Show a "Payment Successful" message when the user is registered.
- The basic validations which I did in the project are as follows:-
   - Every input field should be filled by the user.
   - User name must not be empty.
   - Age field must be between 18 and 65 years.
   - Gender should must be specified by the user.
   - Contact number must consist of 10 digits.
   - Fees should be exactly equal to 500.
   - User must select a slot in order to make the payment.
The project lacks payment method else it can be used for real world applications.
